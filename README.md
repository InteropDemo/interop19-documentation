# Interop19 Network Orchestration & Automation Demo
In the following repositories you will find content relating to the Interop19 in Las Vegas, Nevada Network Orchestration Hands-On Showcase, including documentation and source files for use at home or in the demo lab.  This pages serves as a Table of Contents of these resources.

### Mission Statement
- Provide practical demonstrations of some of the issues surround DevOps interoperability and utilize concepts being discussed in the Conference tracks in the areas of Security, Infrastructure and Data Analytics.
- Break down the complexity by providing demonstrations that illustrate each technical specialty, led by members of Interop’s volunteer engineering team

### What we are doing?
- We have been tasked to provide practical demonstrations of DevOps concepts that exist right now using available tools and experience-built scenarios to understand future capabilities.
- We’re demonstrating these tools and systems within the scope of how they can be applied to Infrastructure deployment and management.

### Why are we doing it?
- The days of ‘conf t’ are waning for network engineers, the automation of system management and deployment is the future.
- This blurs the lines between traditional network engineer and combines the skills of system administration and developer.
- DevOps is going mainstream.
- Being prepared will give an individual or organization a competitive advantage.
- We thought it may be interesting.

### Who are we?
- A small team of Interop/InteropNet veterans who enjoy researching and detailing new concepts in networking.
- We are motivated by the desire for knowledge and the opportunity to share and receive greater understanding through open exchange of information.
- We are not DevOps experts.  We are Infrastructure experts researching how DevOps can benefit the IT industry.
